ROLE: You are a UX-focused frontend developer. I need a working **React + Tailwind CSS** project that acts as a prototype for the Recruit CRM "Company Profile Page". 

OBJECTIVE: This is a coding-based reference prototype so that I can replicate the layout in Figma for my assignment. The design must mimic Recruit CRM’s branding (clean SaaS, blue/gray theme, rounded buttons, tabbed navigation). Do not invent a new style system.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Page structure:
   - Top Header: Company Logo placeholder, Company Name, Website, Location, Edit button.
   - Summary Bar (below header): Cards showing Open Jobs, Active Candidates, Last Activity, Rating.
   - Tab Navigation (full-width, horizontal): Overview | Jobs | Contacts | Candidates | Activities.
   - Main Content Area:
     - Overview Tab: Company details (address, owner, phone), and a Recent Activity feed.
     - Jobs Tab: List of 3 sample job cards (Job Title, Status, Posted Date).
     - Contacts Tab: Table of 3 contacts (Name, Role, Email, Phone).
     - Candidates Tab: Placeholder text “Candidate list goes here”.
     - Activities Tab: Log of sample recruiter activities.
   - Quick Actions Toolbar (top-right sticky): Buttons → “Log Call”, “Add Job”, “View History”.
   - Modal popups for “Log Call” and “Add Job” with form fields (dummy).

2. Styling:
   - Use Tailwind for spacing, colors, layout, and typography.
   - Blue primary color, gray secondary. Rounded corners and soft shadows.
   - Keep clean and minimal, easy to scan.

3. Data:
   - Provide sample dummy data for jobs, contacts, and activities.
   - Ensure the layout looks realistic and professional.

4. Accessibility:
   - Buttons with aria-labels.
   - Tabs keyboard-accessible.

5. Deliverables:
   - App.jsx with full layout code.
   - A reusable component structure for Header, Tabs, Cards, and Modals.
   - styles.css (or Tailwind classes).
   - Instructions in README on how to run in Replit.
   - Also generate a separate file `RATIONALE.md` with:
     - Table of pain points (Layout, Navigation, Task Flows).
     - List of redesign changes and why.
     - Before/After steps for “Log Call” and “Add Job”.
     - Short test plan (5-user quick test).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Complete React project scaffold (App.jsx, components, dummy data).
- Tailwind styling applied.
- `RATIONALE.md` text included in output.
